# EmberGeolocate

This is a sample app in EmberJS to demonstrate the mocking of browser geolocation in Selenium automation tests.

## Why EmberJS

It is quick - That's it!! Intent is to show the automation tests behaviour.

## Prerequisites

You will need the following things properly installed on your computer.

* [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (with NPM)
* [Bower](https://bower.io/)
* [Ember CLI](https://ember-cli.com/)
* [PhantomJS](http://phantomjs.org/)

## Installation

* `git clone <repository-url>` this repository
* `cd EmberGeolocate`
* `npm install`
* `bower install`

## Running / Development

* `ember serve`
* Visit your app at [http://localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200).

### Running Tests

This is currently WIP
* `ember test`
* `ember test --server`

### Building

* `ember build` (development)
* `ember build --environment production` (production)

### Note

This is only a demo app to demonstrate the behaviour of browser geolocation and how you can mock this geolocation to make your Selenium tests behave as the location is the one you specified

### WIP

Selenium tests to follow
